# 321-CTF

Mastery Extension for CSC-321

# Goal

A few basic CTF levels with basic flag authentication. The idea was to have the levels reflect some CTF
tactics we learned in class to exploit vulnerabilities. As this is a relatively quick project, the localhost
implementation itself will naturally have some glaring vulnerabilities, but completing the levels as intended
will provide a basic CTF challenge experience. Learning about developing CTF's, as well as how to imagine implementing different vulnerabilities and the challenges that come with it, is all a part of the goal of this
mastery extension. As much as a completely developed CTF experience is the goal, this learning that comes with
it is what I consider most valuable about this project.

# Localhost vs Box

For time purposes, I decided to simulate the CTF via my own localhost. Setting up a CTF box, as it turns out, is a long process. In future iterations of this CTF project (which I will continue to pursure) I will be attempting to create CTF boxes with vulnerabilities, and establishing this project as something that can be more officially seen as a CTF.
